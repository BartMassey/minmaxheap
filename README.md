Copyright (c) 2018 Bart Massey

This module provides an implementation of "min-max heap"
functionality. A min-max heap is built from an array of size
n, and supports O(n) creation, O(lg n) insertion, and
O(lg(n)) extract-min and extract-max.

Please see the source code for references and documentation.
More documentation needs to be inserted here soon.
